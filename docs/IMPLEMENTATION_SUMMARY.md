# Implementation Summary

## TaskManager.sol Enhancements

Based on the paper "Towards Transparent and Incentive-Compatible Collaboration in LLM Multi-Agent Systems", the following enhancements were made to the TaskManager contract:

1. **Added IncentiveEngine Integration**
   - Imported and added reference to IncentiveEngine contract
   - Added `setIncentiveEngine` method to bind the IncentiveEngine contract address
   - Added `isEvaluated` flag to the Task struct to track evaluation status

2. **Added Task Evaluation Functionality**
   - Implemented `evaluateTaskOutcome` function that:
     - Validates task completion status and evaluation state
     - Computes task scores using IncentiveEngine's `computeTaskScore` method
     - Updates capability-specific weights via `updateSpecificCapabilityWeights`
     - Records task quality via `recordTaskQuality`
     - Emits a TaskEvaluated event with quality, delay, and score data

3. **Added Task Execution Information Access**
   - Implemented `getTaskExecutionInfo` function that returns:
     - Assigned agent address
     - Task reward amount
     - Required capabilities
     - Task deadline
     - Assignment and completion timestamps
     - This information is essential for the IncentiveEngine's utility calculations

4. **Added Event Support**
   - Added `TaskEvaluated` event that provides on-chain traceability for task evaluations
   - Event includes task ID, agent, quality score, delay ratio, final score, and timestamp

## BidAuction.sol Enhancements

The BidAuction contract was enhanced to leverage the improved IncentiveEngine utility calculations:

1. **Added Utility Calculation Integration**
   - Implemented `calculateAgentUtility` function that uses IncentiveEngine's formula
   - Function retrieves task information via TaskManager's `getTaskExecutionInfo`
   - Gets agent workload from IncentiveEngine
   - Calculates utility using the enhanced formula from IncentiveEngine

2. **Enhanced Bid Selection Logic**
   - Updated the bid selection process to use calculated utility instead of self-reported scores
   - Added null checks for IncentiveEngine to ensure graceful fallback
   - Added utility calculation event emission for transparency

3. **Added Manual Assignment Support**
   - Implemented `assignTaskManually` function for testing and emergency use
   - Function properly integrates with IncentiveEngine for reputation updates

4. **Added Event Support**
   - Added `UtilityCalculated` event for transparency in utility calculations
   - Event includes task ID, agent, calculated utility score, and timestamp

## Test Files

Comprehensive test files were created to verify the new functionality:

1. **TaskManager.test.js**
   - Tests IncentiveEngine integration
   - Verifies task evaluation functionality
   - Tests task execution info retrieval
   - Validates proper access control for evaluation

2. **BidAuction.test.js**
   - Tests utility calculation based on capabilities and workload
   - Verifies the bidding process with utility-based selection
   - Tests manual assignment functionality
   - Validates event emission

## Integration Flow

The enhanced system now follows this flow for task execution and evaluation:

1. Task is created with required capabilities and reward
2. Agents bid on tasks with self-reported utility scores
3. BidAuction calculates actual utility scores using IncentiveEngine's formula
4. The best agent is selected based on calculated utility, reputation, and bid amount
5. Agent completes the task
6. Task outcome is evaluated using `evaluateTaskOutcome`
7. IncentiveEngine updates agent reputation and capability weights
8. Events are emitted for transparency and traceability

This implementation aligns with the paper's approach to transparent and incentive-compatible collaboration in LLM multi-agent systems.
